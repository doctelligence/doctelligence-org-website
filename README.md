# Welcome to Doctelligence.org!

DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)

be collaborative more than competative...agile and broad to allow time for experimentation and inclusiveness.

Healthcare is displaced within the mindsets of many as a money making machine...we should be building in mind that the ideal total value and holding of the tokens accrues to nothing (o=∞) becuase this will mean indivudals will be healthy as defined by modern medicine. Ideally, doctelligence will have no value and cease to exist (o=∞) reappearing only when it is needed
