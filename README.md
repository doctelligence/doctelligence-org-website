# Welcome to Doctelligence.org!

DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)

Healthcare is not universal right, it is a human collective effort...

As a Foundation because stakeholders of healhtcare when centralised result in the self-interests of the entity over health of the individual

Doctelligence will have no value and cease to exist (o=∞) reappearing only if and when it is needed. 

We should be building in mind that the value of the tokens becomes nothing (o=∞). This will mean indivudals no longer require any healthcare.

Life-oriented and agile allow time for inclusiveness, adaptation, experimentation, and prototyping.
