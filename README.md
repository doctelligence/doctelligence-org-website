# Welcome to Doctelligence.org!

DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)

Doctelligence seeks to scale the adoption of HIE of One by developing and experimenting with the implementation of federated learning protocols distributed on the public blockchain (Ethereum).

We should be building in mind that the value of the tokens becomes nothing (o=∞), as indivudals no longer require healthcare.
Doctelligence will have no value and cease to exist (o=∞) reappearing only when it is needed. 

Healthcare is not universal right, it is a human collective effort. 

We seek to allow time for inclusiveness, adaptation, and prototyping.
