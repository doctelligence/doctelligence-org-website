# Welcome to Doctelligence.org!

DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)

Healthcare is not universal right, nor a universal process, it is a human collective effort...

Ideally, doctelligence will have no value and cease to exist (o=∞) reappearing only when it is needed for healthcare. We should be building in mind that the ideal total value of the tokens is nothing (o=∞) as this will mean indivudals no longer require any healthcare provision

As a Foundation because stakeholders of healhtcare when centralised result in the self-interests of the entity over health of the individual

Be collaborative more than competative...agile, broad and general to allow time for inclusiveness, prototyping and experimentation.
