# Welcome to Doctelligence.org!

DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)

Doctelligence will have no value and cease to exist (o=∞) reappearing only if and when it is needed. 

Healthcare is not universal right, it is a human collective effort.

Life-oriented and agile allow time for inclusiveness, adaptation, and prototyping. We should be building in mind that the value of the tokens becomes nothing (o=∞). This will mean indivudals no longer require any healthcare.
